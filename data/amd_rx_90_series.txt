The Radeon RX 9070 XT is a high-end graphics card by AMD, launched on March 6th, 2025. Built on the 4 nm process, and based on the Navi 48 graphics processor, in its Navi 48 XTX variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on Radeon RX 9070 XT. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games. The Navi 48 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 357 mm² and 53,900 million transistors. It features 4096 shading units, 256 texture mapping units, and 128 ROPs. Also included are 128 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 64 raytracing acceleration cores. AMD has paired 16 GB GDDR6 memory with the Radeon RX 9070 XT, which are connected using a 256-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1660 MHz, which can be boosted up to 2970 MHz, memory is running at 2518 MHz (20.1 Gbps effective).
Being a dual-slot card, the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT draws power from 2x 8-pin power connectors, with power draw rated at 304 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x HDMI 2.1b, 3x DisplayPort 2.1a. Radeon RX 9070 XT is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 5.0 x16 interface. Its price at launch was 599 US Dollars.

The Navi 48 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 357 mm² and 53,900 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked Radeon RX 9070 XT, which uses the same GPU but has all 4096 shaders enabled, AMD has disabled some shading units on the Radeon RX 9070 to reach the product's target shader count. It features 3584 shading units, 224 texture mapping units, and 128 ROPs. Also included are 112 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 56 raytracing acceleration cores. AMD has paired 16 GB GDDR6 memory with the Radeon RX 9070, which are connected using a 256-bit memory interface.
